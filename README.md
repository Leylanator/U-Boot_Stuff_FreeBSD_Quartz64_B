# U-Boot_Stuff_FreeBSD_Quartz64_B
This repo is just to throw the binaries I need for the Quartz64 Model B to load up with u-boot. Binaries are from fresh ports: https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/u-boot-quartz64-b/

Expect a nicer and proper one-stop-shop guide later. But for now, just click through the link.
